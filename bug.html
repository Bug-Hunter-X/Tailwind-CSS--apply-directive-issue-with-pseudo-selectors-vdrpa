This bug occurs when using Tailwind CSS's `@apply` directive with a class that contains a pseudo-selector such as `:hover` or `:focus`.  The `@apply` directive will not correctly apply the styles for the pseudo-selector to the parent element. For example:

```html
<button class="@apply hover:bg-blue-500">
  Click me
</button>
```

This code will not change the background color of the button on hover. Instead, you should apply the hover styles directly to the button:

```html
<button class="hover:bg-blue-500">
  Click me
</button>
```
